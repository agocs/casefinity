/**
 * Port of Hardcase_Gridfinity_Perimeter.f3d — the liner frame that drops into
 * a hard case and registers the bins to a grid.
 *
 * Reverse-engineered from ground-truth/Hardcase_Gridfinity_Perimeter.step
 * (see scripts/diff-aligned.mjs). The border is a thin-walled U-channel open
 * at the top:
 *   - inner (cavity) wall: vertical, WALL_THICK thick, at the cavity boundary;
 *   - outer (case) wall: tapered by the front/side wall draft, meeting the
 *     outer footprint (OVERALL_LENGTH x OVERALL_WIDTH) at the top mouth;
 *   - hollow between the two walls, closed at the bottom by a floor.
 * The cavity opening is OVERALL_* minus the recovered side/front borders
 * (SIDE_BOARDER = L - GRID_SPACING*(floor(L/GRID)-SIDE_BOARDER_BIN_ADD), etc.).
 *
 * Ported (Stages 1-5): the U-channel border walls + floor; the grid-bump
 * features on the inner wall (ribs on the -Y/+X walls, matching grooves on the
 * +Y/-X walls, GRID_BUMP proud/deep, full height, one per grid-cell centre —
 * the bins register against these); the dovetailed split into four border pieces
 * (see splitPieces); configurable divider cross-ribs on the long sides (see
 * addDividers); and the case bottom-corner radius rolled into the outer wall
 * (see outerLoft / filletInset) so the pieces seat cleanly in the case.
 * FLOOR_THICK isn't only the flat floor cap's own height — it also ramps the
 * outer wall's thickness up near the base of that same bottom fillet, so the
 * whole ≤30°-from-horizontal region (a shallow, support-needing overhang, and
 * exactly where a printed piece flexes most) is as thick as the floor rather
 * than dropping straight to WALL_THICK (see floorCollar).
 *
 * Remaining simplification: the foot is a flat floor rather than the real gusset
 * ramp, but the fit-critical outer surface (taper + bottom fillet) matches.
 *
 * The split seams are joined over the FULL height of the frame (see splitPieces).
 * Each seam is closed by a bulkhead filling the U-channel cross-section, and the
 * dovetail runs through it as a vertical prism — a `wallThick` fold on one piece, matching
 * slot on the other. So the pieces assemble by sliding together vertically, and
 * the joint constrains both in-plane axes from the floor to the rim. Vertical
 * separation is deliberately unconstrained: that IS the assembly direction, and
 * the case holds the frame down.
 *
 * This is what the ground truth does and what an earlier port did not. Building
 * the tang by fusing its footprint into a piece's 2-D region and intersecting the
 * frame only materialises it where the hollow U-channel happens to have material
 * in the tang band — which is almost nowhere. Measured at the shipped defaults,
 * the corner tang band sits at y 103..119, but at z=0 the outer footprint reaches
 * only y=102.1 (BOTTOM_CORNER_RADIUS pulls the wall in over the whole bottom
 * fillet), so below z≈19 the band was outside the frame entirely and above it was
 * a sliver of channel. That near-absent joint is why the model briefly carried
 * optional screw bosses at the seams; a full-height dovetail removes the reason
 * for them (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-07-full-height-dovetails-design.md).
 *
 * Print clearances (both default to a nominal fit; dial in per printer/material):
 *   - `clearance` (CLEARANCE) shrinks the whole outer envelope so the assembled
 *     frame drops into the case (default 0 = exact case size);
 *   - `dovetailClear` (BOARDER_DOVETAIL_CLEAR) opens a gap between each tang and
 *     its socket so the four pieces slide together (default 0.2 mm).

 * Extra wall material ramping from FLOOR_THICK at z=0 down to WALL_THICK at
 * z=0.3*bottomCornerRadius (the fillet loft's own next sample). The fillet is
 * a quarter-round of radius r=bottomCornerRadius, so its tangent is θ from
 * horizontal at height r(1−cos θ) — the tangent reaches 30° from horizontal
 * at just r(1−cos30°) ≈ 0.134*r, well inside this ramp's 0..0.3*r span, so
 * the whole ≤30°-from-horizontal zone sits within it. A 30°-from-horizontal
 * overhang is a shallow one in FDM terms (it needs support if left thin) and
 * is exactly where a printed piece flexes most, so thickening it toward the
 * floor's own thickness makes that band self-supporting and stiffens the
 * piece. The ramp must reach ABOVE the flat floor cap's own height (built
 * separately in buildPerimeter, z=0..FLOOR_THICK) or the extra material is
 * entirely masked by it: at typical defaults FLOOR_THICK alone already
 * reaches past the 30° point, so a collar that stopped there would add next
 * to nothing — reaching to 0.3*r instead extends real, unmasked thickness
 * above the floor cap, right where the wall would otherwise drop straight
 * back to WALL_THICK.
 *
 * `wallInner` MUST be the actual `outerLoft(t, p)` already built for the wall
 * cut in buildPerimeter (not re-derived here): the fillet is a circular arc,
 * a nonlinear function of z, and a fresh 2-point loft at inset=t can't
 * reproduce that curve — it comes out MORE pulled-in than the real wall at
 * every intermediate height, so a from-scratch "outer" edge sits entirely
 * inside the real wall's own solid and contributes exactly zero volume when
 * fused (measured — an earlier version did this and the frame's total volume
 * didn't move at all). Restricting the real wallInner to z<=zEnd guarantees
 * the collar's outer face is pixel-for-pixel the same surface as the wall's.
 *
 * The ramp itself is a single, monotonic two-point loft — inset=FLOOR_THICK
 * at z=0 straight to inset=WALL_THICK at zEnd, no intermediate "hold flat
 * then bend" sample. Two earlier attempts added a middle sample (at the 30°
 * height) to keep the near-horizontal zone uniformly thick before ramping:
 * one mixed it into outerLoft's own 5-section spline and it overshot enough
 * to measure LESS total material than before; the other kept it as its own
 * short 3-section loft and *that* overshot too, past the real wall's surface,
 * erasing nearly the whole collar (measured: 350 mm³ instead of the ~2900 mm³
 * a sane ramp gives). A flat-plateau-then-bend profile is exactly the shape
 * that makes a spline loft overshoot regardless of how few points it's split
 * across; a plain monotonic 2-point ramp has no such inflection to overshoot.
 *
 * `outerInnerY` (used by addDividers to trace a rib's outer edge) still
 * assumes a flat WALL_THICK inset; that's conservative here, not wrong — it
 * places the divider's outer edge further out than this collar's actual inner
 * face, so the rib fuse only picks up extra (harmless) overlap, never a gap.

   * Full-height joint. Every seam is closed by a bulkhead filling the U-channel
   * cross-section, `wallThick` thick either side of the seam plane, with the
   * dovetail running through it as a vertical prism. Fused into the frame BEFORE
   * any per-piece region intersect, so the existing region algebra divides it:
   *
   *   tang piece   region = halfplane u tangFootprint
   *                -> end web + a dovetail folded to wallThick
   *   socket piece region = halfplane - grownTang
   *                -> end web pierced by the dovetail mouth, plus flanks and a
   *                   back for the slot
   *
   * Two flat 2-D pieces per seam are enough, because channelSolid trims them to
   * the wall profile:
   *   - `web`, spanning +/-wallThick about the seam plane and the whole half of
   *     the off-axis that this border lies in. A HALF-PLANE, not the nominal
   *     border width: at the corner seams (x = +/-splitX) the cavity's rounded
   *     corner has already turned away, so the channel there is wider than the
   *     border (~40 mm vs 27.5 at the defaults) and a nominal-width band would
   *     leave part of it open. Everything inboard of the cavity wall is removed
   *     by channelSolid's own cavity cut, and the half-plane cannot reach the
   *     opposite rail.
   *   - the socket footprint dilated by one wall thickness, `seamProfile(...,
   *     dovetailClear + wallThick)`. It contains the tang footprint (so the tang
   *     piece gets a solid prism) and stands `wallThick` off the slot on both
   *     flanks and at its far end (so the socket piece gets flanks and the tang
   *     bottoms out against material).
   *
   * A collar wider than the channel is trimmed, not clamped — a dovetail wider
   * than the border just merges into the walls, which is if anything stronger.
   *
   * The tang is a FOLD, not a solid: seamCore removes its interior, so the
   * dovetail is one wall thick all round — like the rest of the frame, and like
   * the ground truth. Above roughly wallThick = w/2 * cos(angle) the erosion
   * degenerates and it comes out solid again on its own.
